            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things whioch the Lord
                hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that
                they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.

            <h2>Maroni 10:32</h2>
            <p>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall
            deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you,
            that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.
